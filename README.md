About Golang
------------

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable,
and efficient software.

Go bears a surface similarity to C. It is much more than an updated version of C and borrows ideas
from many other languages. It focusses more on simplicity, instead of having features that lead to 
complexity and unrelaible code.

From C, Go inherited its expression syntax, control-flow statements, basic data types, call-by-value
parameter passing, pointers, and above all, Câ€™s emphasis on programs that compile to efficient
machine code and cooperate naturally with the abstractions of current operating systems.

Go's facilities for concurrency are new and efficient, and it's approach to data abstraction and
object-oriented programming is unusually flexible. It has automatic memory management or garbage
collection.

Go is a compiled language. The Go toolchain converts a source program and the things it
depends on into instructions in the native machine language of a computer

Go programs run faster than programs written in dynamic languages and suffer far fewer crashes due 
to unexpected type errors.
